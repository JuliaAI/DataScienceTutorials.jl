  ## Completely new to Julia?

  Try one of these [external resources](/external_resources.md):

  - [Julia's learning resources page](https://julialang.org/learning/) 

  - [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/)

  - [HelloJulia](https://github.com/ablaom/HelloJulia.jl)


  ## Machine Learning expert with beginner-level Julia?

  We suggest you start with this tutorial:

  - [Telco Churn (MLJ for Data Scientists in Two
    Hours)](/end-to-end/telco/), *intermediate*, *classification*,
    *one-hot*, *ROC curves*, *confusion matrices*, *feature importance*,
    *feature selection*, *controlling iteration*, *tree booster*,
    *hyper-parameter optimization (tuning)*

  or the [Getting started with
  MLJ](/categories/starting_out_with_mlj.md) tutorials. Alternatively,
  you can try this [external resource](/external_resources.md):

  - [MLJTutorial](https://github.com/ablaom/MLJTutorial.jl): Tutorials
    forming a basis for a day-long workshop on MLJ.

  # New to machine learning but have moderate Julia skills?

  Start out with the [Introduction to Statistical
  Learning](/categories/intro_to_stats_learning.md) tutorials, or one of
  these [external resources](/external_resources.md):

  - [MLCourse](https://github.com/jbrea/MLCourse): Teaching material for
    an introductory machine learning course at EPFL (for an interactive
    preview see [here](https://bio322.epfl.ch)).

  - [Julia Data
    Science](https://github.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience): Book
    focused on exploratory data analysis with less on ML.

  # New to both Julia and machine learning?

  To get started with Julia, you can try one of the external resources
  at the top of [this page](new_to_julia.md). 

  Once you have basic Julia competency, try the [Introduction to
  Statistical Learning](/categories/intro_to_stats_.earning.md)
  tutorials or one of these [external reources](/external_resources.md):

  - [Julia Data
    Science](https://github.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience): Book
