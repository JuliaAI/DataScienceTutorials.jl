  ## Machine Learning expert with beginner-level Julia?

  We suggest you start with this tutorial:

  - [Telco Churn (MLJ for Data Scientists in Two
    Hours)](/end-to-end/telco/), *intermediate*, *classification*,
    *one-hot*, *ROC curves*, *confusion matrices*, *feature importance*,
    *feature selection*, *controlling iteration*, *tree booster*,
    *hyper-parameter optimization (tuning)*

  # New to machine learning but have moderate Julia skills?

  Start out with the [Introduction to Statistical
  Learning](/info/isl) tutorials, or one of
  these [external resources](/info/external-resources):

  - [MLCourse](https://github.com/jbrea/MLCourse): Teaching material for
    an introductory machine learning course at EPFL (for an interactive
