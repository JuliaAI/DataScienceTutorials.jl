    "In some cases, this may be un-ambiguous, for instance if you have a vector of floating point values, this should usually be interpreted as a continuous feature (e.g.: weights, speeds, temperatures, ...).\n",

    "In many other cases however, there may be ambiguities, we list a few examples below:\n",

    "* A vector  of `Int` e.g. `[1, 2, ...]` which should be interpreted as categorical labels,\n",
    "* A vector of `Int` e.g. `[1, 2,  ...]` which should be interpreted as count data,\n",
    "* A vector of `String` e.g. `[\"High\", \"Low\", \"High\", ...]` which should  be  interpreted as ordered categorical labels,\n",
    "* A vector of `String` e.g. `[\"John\", \"Maria\", ...]` which should not interpreted as informative data,\n",
