    "* A vector  of `Int` e.g. `[1, 2, ...]` which should be interpreted as categorical labels,\n",

    "* A vector of `String` e.g. `[\"High\", \"Low\", \"High\", ...]` which should  be  interpreted as ordered categorical labels,\n",
    "* A vector of `String` e.g. `[\"John\", \"Maria\", ...]` which should not interpreted as informative data,\n",
