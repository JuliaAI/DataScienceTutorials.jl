## Elementary data manipulations

If you have some programming experience but are otherwise fairly new to data processing in Julia, you may appreciate the following few tutorials before moving on.
In these we provide an introduction to some of the fundamental packages in the Julia data processing universe such as [DataFrames], [CSV] and [CategoricalArrays].

[DataFrames]: https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl
[CSV]: https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl
[CategoricalArrays]: https://github.com/JuliaData/CategoricalArrays.jl

* How to [load data](/data/loading/),
* Short intro to [dataframes](/data/dataframe/),
* Dealing with [categorical data](/data/categorical/)
* Specifying [data interpretation](/data/scitype/)
