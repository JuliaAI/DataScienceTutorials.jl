## Getting started with MLJ

If you are new to MLJ but are familiar with Julia and with Machine Learning, we recommend you start by going through the short _Getting started_ examples in order:

1. How to [choose a model](/getting-started/choosing-a-model/),
1. How to [fit, predict and transform](/getting-started/fit-and-predict/)
1. How to [tune models](/getting-started/model-tuning/)
1. How to [ensemble models](/getting-started/ensembles/)
1. How to [ensemble models (2)](/getting-started/ensembles-2/)
1. More on [ensembles](/getting-started/ensembles-3/)
1. How to [compose models](/getting-started/composing-models/)
1. How to build a [learning network](/getting-started/learning-networks/)
1. How to [create models](/getting-started/learning-networks-2/) from learning networks
1. An extended tutorial on [stacking](/getting-started/stacking/)

Additionally, you can refer to the [documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/stable/) for more detailed information.
