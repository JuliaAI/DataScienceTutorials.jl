# Tutorials

Some intro + explain structure (TBD)

Explain that "Getting started" is for people who have a good idea of how things work (know the theory) but want to quickly get a feel for how things are done

Suggest some ordering in the end to end examples (ames is simpler)

Todo: in the getting started, need intro to the `params` function in like tuning

Tell people again they must activate.
